            1. Use Google Visualization API to create a bar to represent the user's submitted data, 
            showing them whether it is a good or bad value
            2. Use the same API to graph separate instances of the quiz, so that if the user took it before, 
            they could enter their number and the say they took it. That way each of the points could be graphed to show whether the user's health has improved
